For this project I started by changing the properties of the cube so that it would behave like the gif. I changed the mass, the drag and the speed so that it would move at a reasonable speed and fall through the platforms. I changed the collision detection to continuous so that the player would not pass through the floor or walls.
Then I proceeded with creating the spawning of the platforms. I made new different platform prefabs and created the script "PlatformGenerator" that spawns a new platform when the previous platform reaches a point in the sceen.
